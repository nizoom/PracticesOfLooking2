Ideology informs the design of shelters for displaced people, by arranging homes as if in a perspectival grid that organizes, manages and contains its inhabitants. The emphasis in the photograph on the planar and linear leaves out texture, straightening and arranging what could be perceived as deviance. Where one can circulate is restricted and prescribed. Their freedom is limited. What's complicated and vulnerable becomes smoothly encased and hidden. The camp as a designed living space is on a flat raised terrain, with no plant structures, no shade, no cultural centers, public transportation, it is remote and isolated.  Brown arid ground indicates a hot and dry climate. Small squares of shade help protect but are they enough to seek refuge from the environmental conditions of heat? The camp land is doubly enclosed, both within the fence, the surrounding road, and the hill. A small parking lot to the bottom of the image shows vehicles but we know they don‚Äôt belong to the residents who are isolated spatially and marginalized from society at large.",
